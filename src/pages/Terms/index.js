                    <p className="w-full p-2">
                    4.1 The following services (the “Digital Currency Services”) may be provided to you by NATURE DAO: a. one or more hosted digital currency wallets enabling you to store, track, transfer, and manage balances of certain supported digital currencies including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Rio Fuel (RFUEL) and Bitpool Token (BIT) (the “Digital Currency Wallet” and “Digital Currency” respectively); b. one or more hosted digital wallet enabling you to store electronic money issued by NATURE DAO (the "E-Money Wallet" and "E-Money" respectively) (collectively, the “E-Money Services”); c. certain payment services enabling you to send and receive E-Money; and d. a Digital Currency exchange service enabling you to obtain prices for your purchases and sales of Digital Currencies, and (subject to certain restrictions) carry out any such purchases or sales on the Sites.
                    </p>
                    <p className="w-full p-2">
                    4.2 Your Digital Currency Wallet enables you to send Digital Currency to, and request, receive, and store Digital Currency from, third parties by giving instructions through the Sites (each such transaction is a "Digital Currency Transaction"). The Digital Currency Exchange Service enables you to buy Digital Currency using: a. E-Money from / into your E-Money Wallet; and / or b. Central bank issued currency (such as SGD or EUR) supported by NATURE DAO.
                    </p>
                    <p className="w-full p-2">
                    4.3 Conversely, when you sell Digital Currency you may elect to receive: a. E-Money into your E-Money Wallet; and / or b. Central bank issued currency (such as GBP or EUR) supported by NATURE DAO.
                    </p>
                    <p className="w-full p-2">
                    4.4 You may purchase supported Digital Currency by linking a valid payment method to your Digital Currency Wallet. You authorise us to debit funds using your selected payment method(s) to complete your purchase. Although we will attempt to deliver Digital Currency to you as promptly as possible, funds may be debited from your selected payment method before the status of your Digital Currency transaction is shown as complete, and it is delivered to your Digital Currency Wallet. You may sell Digital Currency in exchange for fiat currency (such as SGD or EUR) supported by NATURE DAO. In such circumstances, you authorise us to debit your Digital Currency Wallet and to send instructions to credit your selected payment method(s) in settlement of sell transactions. We will send these instructions as soon as reasonably possible. Any fiat currency should be credited to your selected payment method(s) by the end of the business day after we send such instructions.
                    </p>
                    <p className="w-full p-2">
                    4.5 We will make reasonable efforts to fulfil all purchases of Digital Currency, but in some circumstances, we may be unable to. If this is the case, we will notify you and seek your approval to re-attempt the purchase at the current Exchange Rate (as defined below).
                    </p>
                    <p className="w-full p-2">
                    4.6 The availability of a method of payment depends on a number of factors including, for example, where you are located, the identification information you have provided to us, and limitations imposed by third party payment processors.    
                    </p>
                    <p className="w-full p-2">
                    4.7 Each purchase or sale of Digital Currency is subject to a fee (a "Conversion Fee"). The applicable Conversion Fee will be displayed to you on the Site prior to each transaction and is stated in each receipt we issue to you. We may adjust our Conversion Fees at any time. We will not process a transaction if the Conversion Fee and any other associated fees would, together, exceed the value of your transaction.    
                    </p>
                    <p className="w-full p-2">
                    4.8 Each purchase or sale of Digital Currency is also subject to the Exchange Rate for the given transaction. The "Exchange Rate" means the price of a given supported Digital Currency in fiat currency as quoted on the Sites. The Exchange Rate is stated either as a "Buy Price" or as a "Sell Price", which is the price at which you may buy or sell Digital Currency, respectively.
                    </p>
                    <p className="w-full p-2">
                    4.9 You acknowledge that the Buy Price Exchange Rate may not be the same as the Sell Price Exchange Rate at any given time, and that we may add a margin or ‘spread’ to the quoted Exchange Rate. You agree to accept the Exchange Rate when you authorise a transaction. We do not guarantee that you will be able to buy and / or sell your Digital Currency on the open market at any particular price or time.    
                    </p>
                    <p className="w-full p-2">
                    4.10 By clicking the Buy or Sell button on the Sites, you are authorising NATURE DAO to initiate the transaction at the quoted Buy Price or Sell Price and agree to any associated Conversion Fees and Exchange Fees. You cannot cancel, reverse, or change any transaction marked as complete or pending. If your payment is not successful or if your payment method has insufficient funds, you authorise us, in our sole discretion, either to cancel the transaction or to debit your other payment methods, including balances on your E-Money Wallet and/or Digital Currency Wallets, in any amount necessary to complete the transaction. You are responsible for maintaining an adequate balance and/or sufficient credit limits in order to avoid overdraft, insufficient funds, or similar fees charged by your payment provider.

                    <p className="w-full p-2">
                    4.11 We will process Digital Currency Transactions in accordance with the instructions we receive from you. You should verify all transaction information prior to submitting instructions to us. We do not guarantee the identity of any user, receiver, requestee or other third party and we will have no liability or responsibility for ensuring that the information you provide is accurate and complete.    
                    </p>
                    <p className="w-full p-2">
                    4.12 Digital Currency Transactions cannot be reversed once they have been broadcast to the relevant Digital Currency network.

                    <p className="w-full p-2">
                    4.13 We may charge network fees ("transaction fees") to process a Digital Currency Transaction on your behalf. We will calculate the transaction fees at our discretion, although we will always notify you of the transaction fees at (or before) the time you authorise the Digital Currency Transaction. Transaction fees for each individual transaction will be disclosed to you at the time of purchase on the checkout page. When you or a third party sends Digital Currency to a wallet from an external wallet not hosted by NATURE DAO, the person initiating the transaction is solely responsible for executing the transaction properly, which may include, among other things, payment of transaction fees in order for the transaction to be successful. Non-payment of transaction fees may cause your transaction to remain in a pending state outside of NATURE DAO’s control and we are not responsible for delays or loss incurred as a result of an error in the initiation of the transaction and have no obligation to assist in the remediation of such transactions.    
                    </p>
                    <p className="w-full p-2">
                    4.14 Once submitted to a Digital Currency network, a Digital Currency Transaction will be unconfirmed for a period of time pending sufficient confirmation of the transaction by the Digital Currency network. A Digital Currency Transaction is not complete while it is in a pending state. Digital Currency associated with Digital Currency Transactions that are in a pending state will be designated accordingly and will not be included in your Digital Currency Wallet balance or be available to conduct Digital Currency Transactions until confirmed by the network.
                    </p>
                    <p className="w-full p-2">
                    4.15 Under no circumstances should you attempt to use your Digital Currency Wallet to store, send, request, or receive digital currencies in any form that we do not support (although we will use reasonable efforts to help you move or sell Digital Currency that we no longer support). We assume no responsibility or liability in connection with any attempt to use your Digital Currency Wallet for digital currencies that we do not support. Please contact us if you have any questions about which Digital Currencies we currently support.    
                    </p>
                    <p className="w-full p-2">
                    4.16 If you set up a recurring purchase of Digital Currency (a "Future Transaction"), you authorise us to initiate recurring electronic payments in accordance with your selected Digital Currency Transaction and any corresponding payment accounts, such as direct debits from, or credits to, your linked bank account. Your recurring transactions will occur in identical, periodic instalments, based on your period selection (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly), until either you or NATURE DAO cancels the recurring order. If you select a bank account as your payment method for a recurring transaction, and such transaction falls on a weekend or holiday in the location in which the relevant bank is location, or after the relevant bank’s business hours, the credit or debit will be executed on the next business day, although the Digital Currency fees at the time of the regularly-scheduled transaction will apply. If your bank is unable to process any payment to NATURE DAO, we will notify you of cancellation of the transaction and may avail ourselves of remedies set forth in this Agreement to recover any amount owed to NATURE DAO. This authorisation will remain in full force and effect until you change your recurring transaction settings or until you provide us with written notice. You agree to notify NATURE DAO in writing of any changes in your linked bank account information prior to a recurring transaction.   
                    </p>
                    <p className="w-full p-2">
                    4.17 Unless specifically announced on the Site or via an official public statement of NATURE DAO, we do not support metacoins, coloured coins, side chains, or other derivative, enhanced, or forked protocols, tokens, or coins which supplement or interact with a Digital Currency we support (collectively, "Advanced Protocols"). You should not use your NATURE DAO Account to attempt to receive, request, send, store, or engage in any other type of transaction involving an Advanced Protocol. Our platform is not configured to detect and/or secure Advanced Protocol transactions.     
                    </p>
                    <p className="w-full p-2">
                    4.18 NATURE DAO securely stores Digital Currency private keys, in a combination of online and offline storage, which are the means by which you can securely approve a Digital Currency Transaction. As a result of our security protocols, it may be necessary for us to retrieve private keys or related information from offline storage in order to facilitate a Digital Currency Transaction in accordance with your instructions, and you acknowledge that this may delay the initiation or crediting of such Digital Currency Transaction.
                    </p>
                    <p className="w-full p-2">
                    4.19 We have no control over, or liability for, the delivery, quality, safety, legality or any other aspect of any goods or services that you may purchase from, or sell to, any third party (including other users of the Digital Currency Services). We are not responsible for ensuring that a third party buyer or a seller you transact with will complete the transaction or is authorised to do so. If you experience a problem with any goods or services purchased from, or sold to, any third party using Digital Currency transferred using the Digital Currency Services, or if you have a dispute with such third party, you should resolve the dispute directly with that third party.
                    </p>
                    <p className="w-full p-2">
                    4.20 We do not own or control the underlying software protocols which govern the operation of Digital Currencies supported on our platform. Generally, the underlying protocols are ‘open source’ and anyone can use, copy, modify, and distribute them. We assume no responsibility for the operation of the underlying protocols and we are not able to guarantee their functionality, security, or availability. You acknowledge and accept the risk that underlying software protocols relating to any Digital Currency you store in your Digital Currency Wallet may change.
                    </p>
                    <p className="w-full p-2">
                    4.21 In particular, the underlying protocols are likely to be subject to sudden changes in operating rules ("forks"), and such forks may materially affect the value, function, and/or the name of the Digital Currency you store in your Digital Currency Wallet. Where possible, we may provide you with notices or alerts on forks in accordance with this Agreement below and you must read such notices or alerts received from us to consider how to deal with upcoming forks.    
                    </p>
                    <p className="w-full p-2">
                    4.22 However, it is your responsibility to make yourself aware of, and consider how to deal with, upcoming forks. In the event of a fork, there is a risk that we may need to temporarily suspend operations in relation to that fork without providing advance notice to you. We may, in our reasonable discretion, decline to support either or both branches of a fork. You acknowledge the risks presented by forks and you accept that we have no responsibility to assist you to move or sell an unsupported branch of a forked protocol.    
                    </p>

                    4.23 All Digital Currencies held in your Digital Currency Wallet are custodial assets held by NATURE DAO for your benefit. Among other things, this means: a. Title to Digital Currency shall at all times remain with you and shall not transfer to any company in NATURE DAO. As the owner of Digital Currency in your Digital Currency Wallet, you shall bear all risk of loss of such Digital Currency. No company within NATURE DAO shall have any liability for fluctuations in the fiat currency value of Digital Currency held in your Digital Currency Wallet. b. You control the Digital Currencies held in your Digital Currency Wallet. At any time, subject to outages, downtime, and other applicable policies, you may withdraw your Digital Currency by sending it to a different blockchain address controlled by you or a third party. c. In order to more securely custody assets, NATURE DAO may use shared blockchain addresses, controlled by a member of NATURE DAO, to hold Digital Currencies held on behalf of customers. Although we maintain separate ledger accounting entries for customer and NATURE DAO Accounts, no member of NATURE DAO shall have any obligation to segregate by blockchain address Digital Currencies owned by you from Digital Currencies owned by other customers or by any member of NATURE DAO.

                    <p className="w-full p-2">
                    6.1 You can load funds into your E-Money Wallet using one of the payment methods available on the Sites, such as a credit or debit card or bank transfer (your E-Money Wallet will show loaded funds once we have received them). Loading of funds may be done manually, or as part of a recurring transaction that you set up on your NATURE DAO Account. When funds are loaded into the E-Money Wallet you will be issued with E-Money that represents the funds you have loaded. NATURE DAO will only hold funds received from users in a designated safekeeping account with a regulated financial institution. E-Money held in an E-Money Wallet will not earn any interest. Your E-Money Wallet may hold E-Money denominated in different currencies and we will show the E-Money balance for each currency that you hold.   
                    </p>
                    <p className="w-full p-2">
                    6.2 You may purchase supported Digital Currency by using E-Money credited to your E-Money Wallet. To carry out a Digital Currency Transaction using E-Money, you must follow the relevant instructions on the relevant Sites. A Digital Currency Transaction using E-money should normally be settled no later than one business day after we receive your instructions. You authorise us to debit E-Money from your E-Money Wallet. Although we will attempt to deliver Digital Currency to you as promptly as possible, E-Money may be debited from your E-Money Wallet before Digital Currency is delivered to your Digital Currency Wallet.    
                    </p>
                    <p className="w-full p-2">
                    6.3 You may sell Digital Currency in exchange for E-Money. You authorise us to debit your Digital Currency Wallet and credit your E-Money Wallet with the relevant amount of E-Money.    
                    </p>
                    <p className="w-full p-2">
                    6.4 If we receive instructions from you to purchase Digital Currency using E-Money on a non- business day or after 5 pm (local time of the jurisdiction that you reside in) on a business day, we may treat those instructions as if they were received by us on the following business day.    
                    </p>
                    <p className="w-full p-2">
                    6.5 When you give us instructions to carry out a Digital Currency Transaction using E-Money, you cannot withdraw your consent to that Digital Currency Transaction unless the Digital Currency Transaction is not due to occur until an agreed date in the future e.g. if you have set up Future Transactions. In the case of a Future Transaction, you may withdraw your consent up until the end of the business day before the date that the Future Transaction is due to take place. To withdraw your consent to a Future Transaction, follow the instructions on the relevant Sites.

                    6.6 If a payment to load funds into your E-Money Wallet is not successful, you authorise NATURE DAO, in its sole discretion, either to cancel any related Digital Currency Transactions or to debit your other payment methods, including NATURE DAO balances or other linked accounts, in any amount necessary to complete the Digital Currency Transactions in question. You are responsible for maintaining an adequate balance and/or sufficient credit limits in order to avoid overdraft, or similar fees charged by your payment provider.

                    6.8 You may redeem all or part of any E-Money held in your E-Money Wallet at any time by selecting the relevant option in the Sites and following the instructions. Unless agreed otherwise, funds will be transferred to the bank account you have registered with us. If this Agreement is terminated, we will redeem any E-Money remaining in your E-Money Wallet and transfer funds to the bank account you have registered with us. Prior to redeeming E-Money from your E- Money Wallet, we may conduct checks for the purposes of preventing fraud, money laundering, terrorist financing and other financial crimes. This may mean you are prevented or delayed from withdrawing E-Money until those checks are completed to our reasonable satisfaction in order to comply with our regulatory requirements.

                    6.9 Where a purchase of Digital Currency and / or redemption of E-Money is initiated from your E-Money Wallet using your credentials, we will assume that you authorised such transaction, unless you notify us otherwise. If you believe that a transaction using your E-Money Wallet has been carried out that you did not authorise (an "Unauthorised Transaction"), or if you have reason to believe that a transaction using your E-Money Wallet has been incorrectly carried out or is not complete (an "Incorrect Transaction"), you must contact us as soon as possible, and in any case no later than 12 months after the Unauthorised Transaction or Incorrect Transaction occurred.

                    6.10 It is important that you regularly check your E-Money Wallet balance and your transaction history to ensure any Unauthorised Transactions or Incorrect Transactions are identified and notified to us at the earliest possible opportunity. We are not responsible for any claim for Unauthorised Transactions or Incorrect Transactions unless you have notified us in accordance with this Section 6.9, in which case Section 7 below sets out our respective responsibilities. As further described in Section 7 below, we are not responsible for any claim for Unauthorised Transactions or Incorrect Transactions if you have acted fraudulently, intentionally or with gross negligence and this has resulted in the Unauthorised Transactions or Incorrect Transactions. During any investigation of any actual or potential Unauthorised Transactions or Incorrect Transactions, we reserve the right to suspend your NATURE DAO Account to avoid further losses.

Where we determine that the transaction was authorised, we may reverse that credit and correct errors made in any statement of E-Money Wallet without prior notice to you, although please note that during this period your E-Money Wallet may be temporarily locked to avoid further Unauthorised Transactions. You will also be liable to us (as a debt) for any E-Money you have transferred which was temporarily credited to your E-Money Wallet.
